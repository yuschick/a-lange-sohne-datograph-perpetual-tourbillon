# A Lange & Söhne Datograph Perpetual Tourbillon

One reason I have fallen in love with watchmaking is the inspiration I feel with certain watchmakers and timepieces themselves. The technical feat of laying out complex information in a clean, readable way appeals strongly to my interest in design and UX. While many watchmakers are known for the complicated simplicity of their dials, few (if any) are better than German watchmaker A Lange & Söhne. This particular piece, the Datograph Perpetual Tourbillon, finds a way to bring a lot of information into a dial that is both classical and adventurous. When I first saw this piece and began reading about it I knew this would be my next recreation.

This timepiece includes:

- Perpetual Calendar
  - Day Display
  - Date Display
  - Month Display
  - Year Display
- Day/Night Indicator
- Power Reserve
- Flyback Chronograph
- Moonphase
- Tourbillon (not visible)
